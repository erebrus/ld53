You're always late. Do you even care about your job?
This is why I can't rely on anyone around here. Thanks for nothing.
Typical. Can't anyone do their job properly around here?
You're lucky I don't report you for this. Get it together next time.
Wow, you finally made it. I hope that package wasn't important or anything.
I was starting to think the package got lost in your ant-sized brain.
You know, it's called a deadline for a reason. Maybe try meeting it next time.
Thanks for the delivery... a day late and a dollar short, as usual.
You must have taken the scenic route to get here. Next time, try a map.
I was starting to think you got lost in the break room. Glad you found your way out.
Next time you're running late, just let us know so we can find someone more reliable.
The package was worth a lot more yesterday. Thanks for the delay.
Better late than never, I guess. But barely.
Your tardiness is almost as consistent as the sunrise. Keep up the good work.
