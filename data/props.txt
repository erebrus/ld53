who even considers having a freaking statue at the office, Gawd

a Statue, REALLY?!

gawdy statue cant concentrate while looking at that thing

well at least he seems to have high esteem on himself, the statue is a bit much though

if i get another wrestling joke im gonna be the one pile driving you Jeff

there has to be a limit of how much of a wrestling fan you can be

i think i looked at him playing with his figures on working hours he was screaming and making sound effects

i know you have kids mike we ALL KNOW YOU HAVE KIDS

im so taking the day off on bring your kids to work day...

cant...concentrate....must...dance..

RICK..VOLUME!! there are people here that need to WORK! 

how does he make spreadsheets with his turntable ill never know

i know i said follow your dreams rick but you're taking things way too far

swear i saw a pen levitate the other day, weird

i always get goosebumps near that wand, if only he wasn't on my way to the bathroom

the other day he started spewing dark-speech on the middle of the meeting, lights went off and everything..

a wizard might arrive when he needs to but you still cant be late to that meeting Donny
