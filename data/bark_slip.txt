Looks like someone's not cut out for this job after all.
Nice one, clumsy. That's going to be a mess to clean up.
Way to go, hotshot. You really know how to make a good impression.
Whoops, looks like we're not getting our packages today after all.
Better watch your step next time, buddy. We can't afford any more mistakes around here.
Oh, great. Now we have to wait even longer for our packages to arrive.
Wow, and we thought the courier couldn't get any worse. Nice job proving us wrong.
I'm sure someone will just love receiving a broken package. Good luck explaining that one.
Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse around here. Thanks for the entertainment, courier.
I can't believe they pay you to do this. Might want to consider a different career path, buddy.
