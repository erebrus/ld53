This is unacceptable. You had one job to do and you couldn't even do it on time.
Do you even know what deadlines are? This is why our company is failing. You're useless.
Useless, as usual. You're lucky I need it for a meeting. Don't let this happen again.
This is ridiculous. How hard is it to deliver a package on time? You're incompetent.
Finally decided to grace us with your presence, did you?
Oh great, another delay. I was really hoping to not get any work done today.
Wow, you must have taken the scenic route to get here. Next time, just send the package by snail mail.
Late again? You know, we have deadlines to meet here. Maybe try actually being on time for once.
I was starting to think you forgot about us. It's not like we're important or anything.
Geez, you really know how to make an entrance. Maybe next time you could be fashionably early instead.
I guess punctuality isn't really your thing, huh? Don't worry, we'll just wait around twiddling our thumbs until you get here.
If you were any later, we would have had to send a search party out for you.
Late again? I'm beginning to think you enjoy making us wait.
I was starting to think we'd have to hire a different courier service. You know, one that actually delivers on time.
