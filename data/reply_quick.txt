Finally, something arrived on time around here! Good job.
Oh, you're actually doing your job for once. Congratulations.
Wow, a delivery that's actually on time? Impressive, keep it up.
Finally, someone around here is competent. Thank you.
Wow, I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day. Nice job.
I can't believe it, you actually did something right for once.
Huh, I didn't expect you to be able to pull that off. Impressive.
Color me surprised, you actually delivered that on time. Don't get used to it.
I don't know how you did it, but you managed to get that there faster than I thought possible.
I was expecting that to take much longer, but I guess miracles do happen.
Looks like you finally found your calling, speedy delivery boy.
Well, I'll be. You actually got that there in record time. Keep it up.
I have to admit, I had my doubts, but you proved me wrong. Nicely done.
I'm genuinely impressed. You're not as useless as I thought you were.
