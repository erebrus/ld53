Wow, can't even find your way around this place?
You know, they say ants have great sense of smell. Maybe you should try using yours.
I'm not your personal GPS, you know.
Maybe if you paid more attention during your orientation, you wouldn't have to bother me.
You seem lost in more ways than one.
Why don't you try using those six legs of yours and figure it out yourself?
I'm not sure if I should be more concerned about your lack of direction or your lack of basic social skills.
I'm busy doing actual work, unlike you. Maybe you should learn to multitask.
You're lucky I'm not charging you a consultation fee for this.
I hope you're not in a hurry, because my directions are usually way off.
I will tell you how to find who you are looking for, but I won't be responsible for your eventual demise.
Do I look like a tour guide to you?
Do I really look like I have time for this? 
Maybe try asking someone who actually cares.
Oh great, another lost ant. Let me guess, you don't know your way around here?
I can tell you're new around here. No one else would be foolish enough to ask me for help.
Well, well, well. Look who's lost. I hope you brought a compass and a map.
You really need to work on your navigation skills. 
I'm not sure which is worse, the fact that you're lost or the fact that you're bothering me about it.
I hope you're not in a hurry, because you're wasting my time.
