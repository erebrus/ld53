Oops, sorry about that. I didn't see you there. Maybe you should be more careful.
Looks like someone needs to work on their reflexes. Too bad you're not quick enough.
I hope you have insurance, because that was all your fault.
Maybe you should invest in some better shoes, because those clearly aren't cutting it.
Oh, was that your foot I just tripped over? My bad.
You really need to be more aware of your surroundings. Can't blame me for your lack of focus.
Oopsie, looks like someone's not as agile as they thought they were.
Maybe if you weren't so slow, I wouldn't have to go around you.
You're not exactly light on your feet, are you? Better watch your step next time.
Looks like someone's having a bad day. Maybe you should just stick to desk work.
