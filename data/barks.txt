Why does everything always take so long around here?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my deadlines whooshing by.
I swear, they just hire anyone these days.
I don't have time for this. Can't you see I'm busy?
Why do I even bother coming in to work anymore?
You call that work? I could do it in my sleep.
I can't believe they expect us to work in these conditions.
I'm so sick of these incompetent couriers messing everything up.
Just once, I'd like to get something done without any delays or excuses.
Why do they even bother with deadlines? No one ever meets them anyway.
This is pathetic. Maybe we should just fire you and hire a real courier.
I've never seen such a sorry excuse for a courier. Get your act together, or else.
