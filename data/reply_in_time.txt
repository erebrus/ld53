Finally, someone around here who knows how to do their job. Not like some other people.
I can't believe it, you actually managed to deliver something on time. Miracles do happen.
Oh, it's about time someone around here was able to meet a deadline. Good job, I guess.
Wow, you actually managed to deliver on time for once. Impressive.
Well, you barely made it, but I guess that's better than nothing.
You're lucky I'm not in a bad mood today. Good thing you got here just in time.
I was starting to think you forgot about me. At least you managed to show up before it was too late.
I don't know how you do it, but you managed to deliver on time. Don't get used to it, though.
I was about to report you for negligence, but I guess you made it just in time.
I'll give you credit where credit is due. You managed to deliver on time this time.
I was expecting you to be late as usual, but you surprised me. Good job, I guess.
You made it just in time, but don't expect me to thank you for doing your job.
I was about to file a complaint against you, but you made it just under the wire.
